        Grumpy<h2>

    <p>
        The real leader of the group, Grumpy is ‘agin’ everything. He is grouchy, crabby, and his primary dislike is ‘wimmin’! While his nose is the most prominent part of his face, his soft, tender heart is even bigger under all that gruff veneer – much to his own disgust. When trouble arises, it’s Grumpy who acts first to save the day!
