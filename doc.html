    <p>
        Appearing a bit pompous at times, Doc is the self-appointed lead of the group, but is easily befuddled. Doc’s spectacles often slip a little too far down on his nose and has a habit of getting his words and ideas mixed up. He’s overly gracious and highly efficient in his own mind until an important decision is necessary and his nerves take over, preventing any relevant decision from being made. A little nervous, Doc never seems to know what to do with his hands.
