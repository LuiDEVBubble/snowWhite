    <p>
       Dopey is a loveable, slightly-balmy, child-like fellow who gets a great kick out of life. Imbued with a sense of fun, he is a bit like Harpo-Marx, in that Dopey doesn’t speak, but his sly grin seems to ‘tell all’. Dopey’s garments are at least five sizes too big for him, but that only adds to his charm. Somewhat mischievous, Dopey somehow manages to capture the hearts of everyone.
